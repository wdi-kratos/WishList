# WishList
WDI project #2 / WishList

Concept:
 WishList is a web application that allows the user to create a list of 'wants' and 'haves'. The user creates these items and applies a category and a list of attributes to the items. On the users homepage (WishList) the user can view their 'wants', their 'haves', and all other users 'haves'.
